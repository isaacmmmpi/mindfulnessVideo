      "description": "Mindfulness is a natural quality that we all have. It’s available to us in every moment if we take the time to appreciate it. When we practice mindfulness, we’re practicing the art of creating space for ourselves—space to think, space to breathe, space between ourselves and our reactions. Becoming more aware of where you are and what you’re doing, without becoming overly reactive or overwhelmed by what’s going on around you.",

    "description": "Let's assume you've never heard of mindfulness, don't know what it is, don't understand why we need to practice it in our lives, let's explore this topic together in this video. I will discuss the heart of mindfulness practice and how to cultivate mindfulness in daily life. I will also briefly describe the application of mindfulness in contemporary clinical practice - how to deal with stress, pain and disease, and how to use mindfulness decompression to help patients recover their health. I will also talk about some exciting new areas of scientific research. These studies show that mindfulness training seems to have many other effects. It does change the structure and function of the brain. These data show the significant meaning of the between our thoughts and emotions (especially those that are most likely to trigger our subconscious reactions).",
